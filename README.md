<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Project Screenshot](screenshot.png "Placeholder Screenshot")

This project is a collaboration between [Duck Labs](http://ducklabs.com/) and [EvolveU](https://www.evolveu.ca/) that aims to teach students the entireity of the spectrum of full-stack web development, starting with the visuals and UX of the front-end, and ending with the database and server communcation of the back-end, with the result being a complete and functional website.

Specifically, this work is meant to exemplify the pedagogy of **Project-based Learning**. PBL is an instructional methodology that encourages students to learn and apply knowledge and skills through an engaging experience. PBL presents opportunities for deeper learning in-context and for the development of important skills tied to college and career readiness.

**Why Project-based Learning?**

In essence, the PBL model consists of these seven characteristics:

* Focuses the student on a big open-ended question, challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve.
* Brings what students should academically know, understand, and be able to do into the equation.
* Is inquiry-based.
* Uses 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity, among others.
* Builds student choice into the process.
* Provides opportunities for feedback and revision of the plan and the project.
* Requires students to present their problems, research process, methods, and results.
